                <p>
                  The theme of the 9th APRO GPPed Program is "From Classroom to
                  Practice." This theme emphasizes the crucial transition that
                  pharmacy students and professionals undergo from theoretical
                  learning in academic settings to practical application in
                  real-life healthcare scenarios. It underscores the importance
                  of hands-on experience, ethical principles, and practical
                  skills application in shaping competent and ethical pharmacy
                  practitioners who can positively impact patient care outcomes.
