              <p class="secondary">
                The 9th APRO GPPed Program will be hosted by Fop, Nepal themed
                “From Classroom to practice” . The theme "from classroom to
                practice" underscores the importance of bridging the gap between
                theoretical learning and practical application in the field of
                pharmacy. It emphasizes the transition that pharmacy students or
                professionals need to make from the academic setting to
                real-life scenarios, where they must apply their acquired
                knowledge, practical skills, and ethical principles effectively.
                This theme highlights the significance of hands-on experience
                and experiential learning in shaping competent and ethical
                pharmacy practitioners who can navigate the complexities of
                healthcare settings and contribute positively to patient care
                outcomes. It encourages students and professionals to reflect on
                their classroom learning experiences and integrate them into
                their practice, ultimately enhancing the quality and
                effectiveness of pharmaceutical care delivery.
