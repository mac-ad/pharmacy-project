              <p>
                Tribhuvan International Airport is the only international
                airport of Nepal. Immigration Office, TIA (Tribhuvan
                International Airport) under the Department of Immigration has
                been facilitating tourists flying to Nepal by providing a Visa
                on Arrival. 'On Arrival' visa procedure is very quick and
                simple. You can expect some queues during peak Tourist season.
                If you wish to skip those queues, you can also consider getting
                a Visa from Nepalese Diplomatic Missions stationed abroad prior
                to your arrival. Choice is yours.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have obtained a visa from Nepalese Diplomatic Missions,
                then you must enter Nepal within six months from the visa issued
                date. Your total stay is counted starting from the day you enter
                Nepal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Visas obtained on Arrival at the Entry and Exit points are
                'Tourist Visas'. They bear multiple Re-entry facilities. Tourist
                Visa 'On Arrival' is the only entry visa to Nepal. If you are
                visiting Nepal for purposes other than Tourism (sightseeing,
                tour, travel, mountaineering, trekking, visiting friends and
                families), you should still get a ' Tourist Visa' to get into
                the country
              </p>
              <p>
                However, you must change the category of visa as per your
                purpose and length of stay in Nepal from the Department of
                Immigration by producing required documents.
              </p>
